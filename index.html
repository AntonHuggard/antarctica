                <p>
                    In book II of <em>Meteorologica</em> (c.340 BC), Aristotle speculated: <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <em>"There are two inhabitable sections of the earth: one near our upper, or nothern pole, the other near the other or <strong>southern pole</strong>; and their shape is like that of a tambourine. If you draw lines from the centre of the earth they cut out a drum-shaped figure. The lines form two cones; the base of the one is the tropic, of the other the ever visible circle, their vertex is at the centre of the earth. Two other cones towards the south pole give corresponding segments of the earth. These sections alone are habitable. Beyond the tropics no one can live: for there the shade would not fall to the north, whereas the earth is known to be uninhabitable before the sun is in the zenith or the shade is thrown to the south: and <strong>the regions below the Bear are uninhabitable because of the cold</strong>."</em>

                    19th century New Zealand ethnologist <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2s33/smith-stephenson-percy">Stephenson Percy Smith</a> recorded
                    a lot of Maori and Polynesian oral tradition.  <br/>
                    <br/>
                    One notable story recorded by Smith was of Hui Te Rangiora/Ui Te Rangiora, a Rarotongan navigator.
                    Te Rangiora sailed south in a vessel called <em>Te Ivi o Atea</em> and reached a land called Tai-uka-a-pia.
                    This is described as "<em>a foggy, misty, and dark place not seen by the sun. Other things are like rocks, whose summits pierce the skies, they are completely bare and without any vegetation on them</em>".

                <p>
                    Smith was convinced this referred to Antarctica. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, the consensus of modern scholarship (including from Ngai Tahu Maori) is that 
                    seventh century Polynesian sailors reaching the Antarctic is doubtful. 
                    For context, this is at least four centuries before Polynesians reached New Zealand.

                <p>
                    There is archaeological evidence of Polynesian settlement of Enderby Island (460km south of mainland New Zealand).
                    This is the southmost known point of Polynesian exploration.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Remains left behind by Polynesian settlers (tools, fish hooks and bones left in an earth oven) and their dogs at Sandy Bay have been radiocabon dated to the thirteenth or fourteenth century.  
                    These chaps lived on a hearty diet of sea lions, fur seals, albatrosses, and penguins.
                    They were on the Enderby island for at least one summer but don't seem to have made a permanent settlement. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Auckland Islands were uninhabited when they were found by a European whaling ship in 1806.

                    This essentially made some poor sod in Spain reponsible for a non-existent continent.

                    On his first voyage (1768-1771), James Cook observed the Transit of Venus in Tahiti then searched in vain for Terra Australis.
                    He sailed around the coastline of New Zealand and Eastern Australia, unable to find the missing continent.
                    Back in Britain, the Royal Society (notably Alexander Dalrymple) insisted that a Southern Continent <em>should</em> exist.
                    So Cook, with the ships <em>Resolution</em> and <em>Adventure</em>, was sent back to have another look.

                    In December of 1772, Cook found an Island (Bouvet Island) reported by an earlier French navigator. 
                    They kept heading south and eventually met "ice islands". 
                    On 17 January 1773, they reached the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle">Antarctic circle</a>. 
                    Then it got too cold so they retreated.

                    During the long polar night, one sailor went mad and left the ship to "walk home to Belgium".
                    Also, quite naturally, scurvy became an issue. 
                    Frederick Cook, an American onboard, believed raw meat was a cure based on stories he had heard about Robert Peary (an American Arctic explorer).
                    He insisted the crew eat raw penguin and seal meat every day. 
                    Gradually, the crew recovered.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It is now known that raw meat and organs contain a small amount of Vitamin C.

                    The main target of this expedition was to be the first to the South Pole. 
                    They failed in this objective - but it was a near miss. 
                    Shackleton was only 180 km off.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    They set a new record for southward exploration.
                    Interestingly, this expedition had a lack government support and was entirely dependent on private loans.
                    As a result, the expedition was done on a budget and the ship <em>Nimrod</em> was considerably smaller than Scott's <em>Discovery</em>.

                    <br/>
                    Amundsen was initially planning to reach the North Pole but, upon hearing of Britain's Terra Nova Expedition, he changed his plans.
                    He didn't tell anyone about his change of plans out of fear that he would lose his funding.
                    Scott visited Norway to test his motor sledges and called Amundsen to discuss cooperation - Amundsen didn't answer the phone. 
                    Unlike the British, the Norwegians were perfectly happy using skis and sledge dogs, which they believed were the most efficient method of Arctic transport.

                    On 9 August 1910, the ship <em>Fram</em> left Norway for the South Pole.
                    They arrived at the Bay of Whales on 14 January 1911 and set up base (<em>Framheim</em>/home of Fram).

                    On the 8th of March, in difficult conditions, they stopped at 82° S.
                    The dogs were exhausted. 
                    The party then turned for home and reached Framheim on 22 March.

                <p>
                    The sun set over Framheim on 21 April, not to reappear for four months.
                    Amundsen was well aware of the problems faced by <em>Belgica</em> and ensured the party was kept busy.
                    At sunrise on 24 August seven sledges were made ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the cold delayed them for a fortnight.
                    On 8 September 1911, when the temperature rose to -27 °C, Amundsen became impatient, and the party set off.
                    One man recorded that his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly fell down a crevasse when a snow bridge broke underneath them.
                    Despite this near death experience they were covering more than 28 km a day, and reached their 82° S depot on 5 November.
                    On 17 November they reached the edge of the Barrier and faced the Transantarctic Mountains.
                    They spent a few days poking around the foothills and eventually found an apparently clear route, a steep glacier 56 km long leading upwards to the plateau.
                    After three days of difficult climbing the party reached the glacier summit.

                <p>
                    When the party reached the summit of the glacier (at 85° S), Amundsen made preparations for the final stage of the adventure.
                    With heavyy hearts, they were forced to kill and eat some of their dogs.
                    On 25 November, they set off into the fog.
                    On 8 December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's record of 88°.

                    In Melbourne, Scott received a telegram informing him that Amundsen was "proceeding south".

                    <em>Terra Nove</em> left New Zealand for Antartica on 29 November 1910.
                    The overladen ship encountered a storm and lost loss of two ponies, a dog, 10,000 kg of coal and 300 L of petrol.
                    The ship then met pack ice, stalling the expedition by twenty days.

                    On 26 January, Campbell took the ship and headed east towards the Bay of Whales, where he discovered Amundsen's camp.
